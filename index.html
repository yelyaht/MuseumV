      <h3>Origin</h3>
      <p>
        The oldest vampire myths are not of the undead—but of the Unyielding, a
        race of once-mortal kings and prophets who defied death itself. In the
        Age Before Ash, there was a pact made in the shadows of the dying moon:
        a mortal named Kael of Durran bargained with an exiled god to protect
        his dying kingdom from oblivion. In exchange for immortality, Kael
        offered his mortality—and more terribly, his reflection, so that he
        could no longer see the man he became.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that bargain was born the Curse of the Bloodmark. Kael was the
        first to hunger, but he would not be the last. Every vampire descends
        from that moment, bound by blood not to the body—but to memory, power,
        and the cost of defying the natural order.
      </p>
      <h3>The Curse of Blood and Time</h3>
      <p>
        Vampires are not merely undead—they are suspended, trapped between
        moments, unable to decay yet never truly living. Their blood does not
        flow; it remembers. It stores ages, languages, secrets. The longer a
        vampire exists, the more memories they absorb from those they feed upon,
        until their minds fracture with the weight of stolen lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sun does not burn them because of light—it burns them because it
        represents truth. A vampire’s very existence is a lie against time and
        mortality, and the universe punishes that with flame. They cannot cross
        running water, not because of superstition, but because flowing water is
        the symbol of time’s passage, and they are beings rejected by time.
      </p>
      <h3>The Three Houses of Night</h3>
      <p>
        Vampire society is divided into Three Ancient Houses, each descended
        from Kael’s original followers, each carrying a different Blood Gift:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>House Virellan – Known as the Crimson Scholars. These vampires hoard
          memories and knowledge, drinking minds as much as blood. Some serve as
          immortal archivists, others as master manipulators who rewrite history
          from the shadows.</li>
        <li>House Dravari – The Sable Warriors, born of the battlefield. Their
          gift is blood-strength—when they drink, they temporarily inherit the
          physical prowess and skills of their victims. Some become protectors;
          others, horrors of war.</li>
        <li>House Nocturne – The Hollow Court. The most secretive and cursed,
          they feed not on blood, but on emotion—regret, fear, longing. They
          appear rarely, but their victims are left as empty shells, alive but
          broken.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Each House is ruled by a Thirstmother or Bloodfather, said to retain
        fragments of Kael’s original will. They do not war with one another
        openly—but their schemes have shaped empires and toppled gods.
      </p>
    <h3>The Crimson Silence</h3>
      <p>
        One legend warns of a time called the Crimson Silence, when vampires no
        longer feed on mortals—but on each other. This cataclysm would occur
        when the world forgets how to fear them, and their blood runs stale. In
        that era, the eldest—called The Withered—will awaken from beneath cities,
        catacombs, and even dreams, seeking fresh memory and chaos. It is said
        that a single drop of a Withered’s blood can give a mortal the lifespan
        of a century… or burn their soul from the inside.
      </p>
    <h3>Modern Whispers</h3>
      <p>
        Some say vampires walk unnoticed among us—not as gothic relics, but as
        tycoons, surgeons, artists, and archivists. They collect your stories in
        return for small favors. They never cast shadows in photographs—not
        because they are invisible, but because the camera forgets them. They
        are not afraid of garlic or crosses. They are afraid of being remembered
        as monsters… and of the god they betrayed, who may one day return to
        claim what was stolen.
